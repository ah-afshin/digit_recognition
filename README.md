# mnist digit recognition
A deep learning-based digit recognition project utilizing the MNIST dataset with PyTorch.

## getting started
After installing the requirements, you can run the code via `main.py`. Use the `ui` argument when running `main.py`, You can also specify a custom name for your trained model by adjusting the hyperparameters and passing the name as an argument. However, the model name must include `hu<HIDDEN_UNITS>` so that it can later be recognized and run through the UI.
```bash
python main.py ui
```

This project was created for learning purposes. Iâ€™ve tried to write clear and well-documented code.
If you notice any issues or have suggestions, please let me know! ðŸŒ±
